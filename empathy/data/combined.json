And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking.

It will help, even if it only helps a little. As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things.

Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust.

    "response_post": "Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive? Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature. You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context. Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness. Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life. alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it. when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way. Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer. If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers. You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment. You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self. Stay strong friend Love I wish i speleld better",

The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so.

    "response_post": "It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.",

    "response_post": "Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people. Any job can turn a healthy person depressed - on the contrary, any depressed person can find recovery by engaging in other professions and become successful.",

Focus on yourself and doing things that you enjoy, things that help pull you away from depressive thoughts. get through this",

Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down. Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way.

    "response_post": "Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",

These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing. Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral? I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.",

Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it.

I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression.

I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics.

Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else.",

Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results.

Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods. So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO. *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about. Thanks mom.",

If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",

Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is. Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple.

    "response_post": "Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits. Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well.

I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar. They are there for a reason.",

It is difficult making him happy when his depression is taking a toll on me. I have sacrificed so much of my hapiness for him, and all in the name of love.

This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through. Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck.",

My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!",

If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits.

I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight.

Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.  Edit: sorry for the novella and my poor humor. Brain isnt what it used to be.",

Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone. Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life. Also career changes are very common so since you're in your final year you can just stick it out and know that the future awaits.

    "response_post": "Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.",

When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least.

    "response_post": "I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",

Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed.

So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap.

It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one.

This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.",

The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully). If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway).

    "response_post": "Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up.

Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it.

Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time.

I would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd... mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion. It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones.

It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking.

I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others.

You can get pass this difficult stage and these feelings will eventually leave. But perhaps you've already tried to get help and it hasn't worked. If so, thats ok. Therapy doesn't work for everyone but we can find a way to help you get out of this state so please before picking up that gun think of everything you will be leaving behind. Right now it may feel like you're alone and no one cares, but you won't know what truly will happen if you're dead. You won't be able to see people you love anymore, hear sounds of music or voices, see colours and people around you. A life you could have lived.

Failure after failure in college. I never gave up. And then I was diagnosed with herniated disc which caused me pain for the last two years. Sciatica in my right leg all the time and also in my left leg at times. And I'm going bald which is giving me a lot of confidence problems. And now like the cherry on top , I've been diagnosed with cervical disc problem. Just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 23, how the hell am I supposed to live the rest of my natural life in pain everyday. And the average life span in my family is almost 90 years. My family doesn't seem to understand how bad my pain is. My dad understood it when he saw me limping due to pain in my legs. But my mom and the rest of the family always trivializes it. They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.",

(Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain.",

They will never know what it feels like to accept that this is your life. You will forever be fighting it.

This is a disease of the brain - the part that makes out the very essence of our self, the part that tells us about the world around us, that allows us to draw conclusions about the world, have morality and feel everything from the love poets have written about since the advent of letters to the soul crushing despair ahead of the final override of our animal nature: suicide. If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt. Everest - there you are starving the brain of oxygen and get an impression of it slowly shutting down. People pay a lot of money so they can have the experience and know they pushed through within the day it takes them to do the last stage. I am trapped there. Every day of my life. I can't descend.

Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet. Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs.

Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero. And then it becomes fun trying to keep going and not letting any days slip by. Setting small goals is a good way to get moving. Large goals can seem overwhelming.

    "response_post": "Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way.",

If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then|"

You see the effects of social isolation and the lack of control. I work with a person with ABI and as much he tries to stay positive, the frustration seeps out of him all the time. The little things we take for granted like going to the bank, buying groceries, picking up prescriptions become so regulated and standardized in their lives, that you can't expect any other reaction but frustration. It's affected my personal life with my relatives because I get so angry thinking about how there is no way to make them better and I lash out for the littlest reasons on them. I understand it's all about perspective but in the already depressed state I'm in, I know I'm not cut out to help other people feel better. Putting in my 2 weeks on April 16th, and heading back to school in May. I can't keep working there, it's making me much more emotional than when I started.|"

Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is.

You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level.",

    "response_post": "To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole.",

Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's|"

    "response_post": "I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR",

I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues.

    "response_post": "That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",
